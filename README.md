Mini Project Assessment

Explain why nodejs is powerful for building scalable web applications. and also explain the pros and cons of using nodejs.

Objective

Create a detailed analysis report that explores Node.js's capabilities in building scalable web applications and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages.

Tasks

1. Research and explain the following aspects of Node.js:

- Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
- Single-threaded event loop architecture
- How Node.js handles concurrent connections
- Role of npm (Node Package Manager)

2. Create a comparison table highlighting Node.js scalability features versus traditional server-side technologies

3. Develop a list of pros and cons for Node.js:

Pros:

- Explain performance benefits
- Discuss the vast ecosystem of packages
- Describe the advantage of using Javascript on both frontend and backend
- Cover real-time capabilities
- Discuss corporate adoption and community support

Cons:

- Address CPU-intensive task limitations
- Discuss callback hell and potential solutions
- Cover issues with error handling
- Explain database query challenges

4. Practical Component: Create a simple scalable web application demonstrating Node.js capabilities:

- Build a real-time chat application OR
- Create a basic API with multiple concurrent connections
- Document the implementation and explain how it showcases Node.js's scalability

Deliverables

1. Written Report (1000-1500 words) covering:

- Detailed explanation of Node.js architecture
- Analysis of scalability features
- Comprehensive pros and cons list with examples
- Real-world use cases and examples

2. Code Implementation:

- Source code for the practical component
- Documentation explaining the implementation
- Instructions for running the application
- Performance metrics and scalability tests

Evaluation Criteria

- Understanding of Node.js architecture (25%)

- Analysis depth of pros and cons (25%)

- Quality of practical implementation (30%)

- Documentation and presentation (20%)

Submission Guidelines

1. Submit the written report in .md file
2. Include source code in a ZIP file 
3. Upload zip file in you google drive
4. Submit the link of the google drive
